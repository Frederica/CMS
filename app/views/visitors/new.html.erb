		Iaso provides negotiation power to self-insured employers or union health/ welfare trusts, by delivering both cost and quality information to plan sponsors before they seek costly inpatient care. <br><br> Iaso increases the efficiency of cost negotiations between provider and plan sponsor by exposing industry price-setting data to the 59% of corporations who self-insure. Our algorithm is built on the understanding that provider specialization leads to higher quality and lower costs (R=0.13, p<.05). Given a set of natural language DRGs, the Iaso algorithm uses 5 performance indicators, made up of quality, specialty, and cost-value data. We identify the best providers and limit results to a small number of distinct providers using a discrete knapsack optimization, thus ensuring that plan sponsors only need to negotiate with a manageable number of providers. The result is cost and quality delivered to both plan sponsor and participant.
